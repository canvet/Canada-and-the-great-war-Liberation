    Private J. Arthur Maguire of the 2nd Battalion enlisted at age 21 in January 1915. He survived three years in the trenches of the Western Front, but he watched many friends die in combat. 
    Maguire’s experience shook him to the core: near misses from bullets and shell splinters, the clash of battle, the haunting feeling of making it through the Armageddon of fire when so many chums did not. And yet he experienced a significant period of relief, even joy, near the end of the war.<br><br>
    
    In mid-October 1918, Maguire and his comrades were pushing the Germans back after inflicting a momentous defeat on the Kaiser’s forces by driving them out of Cambrai, France, on Oct. 8-9. The Canucks bled for that victory, but it broke the back of the enemy defences, delivering a fatal blow to their immobile logistical system of roads and rail lines that converged on Cambrai. As the weary Canadian survivors of the two-week battle to capture Cambrai marched east in pursuit of the fleeing Germans, they encountered French villages that had suffered under four years of occupation.

          In one small settlement consisting of only a few stone farmhouses and shell-ruined barns, Maguire and his comrades advanced cautiously, with stray shells landing in and around the village from the enemy only a few kilometres away. But they were soon surprised to be greeted by dozens of cheering civilians who rushed from their cellars and hiding places. The worried Canucks waved at the French farmers to take cover, but they refused to pay heed, too enraptured with their moment of liberation. “They were so glad to see us,” Maguire later wrote, “they wept with joy.” <br> <br>
      
          The French hailed the Canadians, breaking out beer, “vin blanc,” and even some hidden cognac that was dug up after years of lying in the ground waiting for this moment of freedom. The French did not have much, but they wanted to give it to the battle-scarred Canadians who had crossed the Atlantic and sacrificed so much to fight for liberty.

        This is a story that is in no way different than that of the Canadian liberators of 1945 who freed the Dutch from their German overlords. In that war, there was an added race against time as the Dutch were starving. Over the Hunger Winter, the Germans had severely curtailed food, using it as a weapon to force the people into submission and to punish them for their resistance.  <br> <br>

        The Canadians drove the Germans back in April and May 1945 and liberated the Dutch, saving countless lives. And for that the Dutch have remained forever grateful to Canada, a tie reinforced by much goodwill and symbolism such as the Canadian Tulip Festival in Ottawa, with the freedom brought by the Canadians enduring as a touchstone of memory.

          But the story of Maguire and the liberation of the French in the final five weeks of the war in 1918 is not a part of Canada’s social memory around the Great War. Why is that?

The evils of the Nazis and the unimaginable atrocities that culminated in the Holocaust further differentiate the wars. And yet the Canadian, British and other Allied forces were also involved in a war of liberation from 1914 to 1918.

    Canada, as a dominion of the British Empire, went to war when Britain went to war on Aug. 4, 1914. But it was Canadians who would decide the extent of their commitment. Standing by Britain was the primary factor in drawing Canadians into the ranks, but there were other impulses too, not least the outrage over Germany’s invasion and occupation of Belgium and France. <br> <br>

  
    Stories of hardship and atrocity were amplified by propaganda, but there was a core truth that from late 1914 Germany was occupying 20 per cent of Belgium and about five per cent of France, including two million people in the northeastern section. Under such conditions, with Germany as a great power smashing its neighbours and occupying lands of Western allies, it is not surprising that Canadians were motivated to action.

    There is clear evidence that Canadians were motivated to serve—to leave behind their homes and loved ones—and to fight far from their shores to liberate the French and Belgians.<br> <br>

  
    But this story has been cast into the dustbin of history, even though, in the final five weeks of the war, the Canadians liberated more than 70,000 French and Belgian citizens and freed more than 200 cities, towns and villages. <br><br> 


    “It made one feel that all this fighting had been worthwhile to see a people so glad to be delivered from hard rulers,” wrote Private William Davidson of the Canadian Field Artillery on taking part in the celebrations in Mons, Belgium, after victory. 
    This is the forgotten story of the Canadian liberators of 1918 who sacrificed and endured to return freedom to the oppressed.

    anada went to war on Aug. 4, 1914. As a dominion of the British Empire, Canada was swept into this European conflict that would eventually explode into a world war. 
    While there were many reasons individual Canadians felt compelled to leave their homes and loved ones to serve, their motivations often included strong ties to the British Empire and a sense of duty in defending its ideals. <br><br>
    
    There were also those who were forced to go for economic reasons or who embarked for adventure. At the same time, many believed in the justness of the cause, especially in liberating the oppressed people of Western Europe. <br><br>

    
    As Canadian politicians and other societal leaders stoked the fires of patriotism, they almost always pointed to the German occupation of Belgium and France. The British and the Canadians both talked of standing up for little Belgium,  citing the Kaiser’s contemptuous phrase that the treaty signed in 1839 guaranteeing Belgian neutrality was but a “scrap of paper.” The British people rebuked the Germans, spoke of honouring their commitments, and Canadians felt the same.

          The invasion of Belgium and subsequent stories of atrocities, real and fabricated, also motivated Canadians to action. The burning of the Leuven library and its 230,000 irreplaceable books and manuscripts, the crimes committed against guerrilla fighters, the execution of some 5,000 partisans and civilians—all real—were mixed with fabricated stories of bayonetting babies and the mass rape of women and girls.

    These atrocities were played up by the British and deliberately distributed in the papers of the Empire and the United States in the hope of enticing the Americans, but they drove many to action in Canada. <br> <br>

    Dan McLellan of Grand River, P.E.I., felt obliged to enlist because of German oppression, writing that he preferred not to fight, “but when a peace-loving country is in distress and thousands of its peaceful, loving citizens driven from their homes by the unjust hand of Prussianism, could you ever forgive a son for being a traitor to those peace-loving people?”

        There was also widespread condemnation of German militarism, known by the common short-hand phrases of Prussianism or Kultur. Prussianism was linked to the Prussians, the most militarized state and class of Germans. Kultur was more amorphous, but it encompassed Germany’s militarized culture of soldiering and discipline. <br> <br>

        Posters and art prints presented the visual story of the occupation, with the popular work of Louis Raemaekers’ displaced people and war refugees appearing in much-reproduced imagery throughout Canada. There were also popular prints, such as Frederick Henry Townsend’s “Bravo Belgium,” showing a resilient boy (Belgium) guarding a gate against a big, stronger and menacing man holding a club (Germany).

    The Red Cross and other patriotic organizations drew on the idea of occupation to inspire Canadians to give money. The Canadian Patriotic Fund, established so that soldiers’ dependants would receive a supplementary income when they enlisted, turned to Western Europe as a warning. One poster, using only red and blue print and without a central image, shared the message: “Can I afford to pay for freedom / Belgium must afford to pay for slavery / Canadians can and must provide for families of those men who are saving us from Belgium’s fate / Subscribe now to the Canadian Patriotic Fund.” <br><br>

    Regimental posters that sought to draw young men to the colours used all manner of messaging, especially emphasizing honour, manliness and the need to serve king and country.

    But portraying this war as a fight for freedom was also prominent. The 199th Battalion (Duchess of Connaught’s Own Irish Rangers)—raised in Montreal—displayed shamrocks and a maple leaf, along with the promise of Irish-Canadians serving together. But the central image of the rather busy poster showed two soldiers clasping hands and pointing to a sign that read: “Small Nations Must Be Free.” It was a direct reference to Belgium, using language that was commonly employed to describe the occupied country, but also a more subtle reference to Ireland.<br><br>

    The fight to free the oppressed of Western Europe stirred many to action. It was the primary cause for some, but more likely one of many emotional reasons that impelled Canadian men to leave their families and communities to go overseas. As French-Canadian soldier and future governor general of Canada, Georges Vanier, recounted, “I could not read the accounts of Belgian sufferings without a deep compassion and an active desire to right…the heinous wrong done.”<br><br>

            hile soldiers enlisted for many reasons, such motivations almost always faded rapidly in the face of the relentless slaughter on the Western Front. <br><br>
            
            The shock of the violence, the depth of the deprivation, and the unending strain in the trenches made the world small for most soldiers. They learned to survive by keeping their heads down and banding together with their mates.<br><br>
        
            Instead of the high ideals and big messages, the soldiers’ small units were crucial in keeping men fighting. Coercion, discipline and rewards bolstered morale. Over time, the soldiers, isolated from civilization and relying on one another, created their own unique fraternity, with strong regimental bonds, all sustained by a soldier’s culture of dark humour, songs, poetry, rumours and superstitions.

            And yet, the liberating ideal persisted. Many employed it to justify why they had left their families to fight the Hun. 
            “Keep up courage Dear and don’t be afraid, and if it should happen that I do go under, I trust you will be proud that I have had the courage to get out and fight against such a domineering race,” wrote George Ormsby to his wife Maggie in his first letter from France. “Should Germany win this war then may God help Canada—in fact the whole world.” <br><br>

        “We have a stronger, nobler purpose leading us all in through the valley of pain and sorrow and sacrifice to the fairer and purer heights of the glorious attainment called an honourable and lasting peace, peace in which the autocrat no longer holds sway and which stands for the liberation of the oppressed and the downtrodden.”

          William Antliff, a prewar student at McGill University, served in a field ambulance. He wrote his mother about the harsh reality of the front, but also what kept him in the fight.<br><br>

          “The newspaper talk about the cheerfulness & devil may care spirit of the Tommy under shell fire is pure bunkum but in spite of this I would sooner a thousand times die and lick the Boche than live under the Prussian tyranny. This isn’t any high-minded noble sacrifice principle but a matter of absolute existence. It is only by every man doing his bit we can win but we are going to win because we can’t afford to lose.” 
Prussian tyranny was a reflection of the Kaiser’s militarized Kultur. Antliff—who survived the war—understood it through the cruel occupation of Belgium and France, and the suffering of the civilians.<br><br>
    
“We all hope that this evil thing which the Allies are fighting will soon be exterminated, because we are of the most part tired of our European tour,” wrote Lieutenant F.G. Newton from Windsor, Ont., before the April 1917 battle for Vimy Ridge. Tired and worn-out, Newton understood the need to see the fight through to the bitter end.

    Another Canuck, Private Richard May, wrote to his mother, “If you could see the hardships and suffering endured by the brave women and children of this unhappy land where so many homes have been ruined, you would not want us to return until victory has been won.”  <br><br>

    May knew that his absence hurt his family, but he asked them to pray “that this high and holy vision may never fade from our minds, and that we may be given courage and patience to finish our task.” It was indeed a high and holy mission, and one that May believed was worth the terrible cost in lives. 
<br><br>

The gift of freedom had to be returned to the persecuted civilians before he or Newton, or the many other Canadians far from home, could return to their loved ones.
